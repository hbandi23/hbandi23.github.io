Welcome to my page! I am a research scientist at nference. My primary focus lies at the intersection of AI and Healthcare, with an emphasis on developing innovative solutions to address pressing challenges in the field. Prior to that, I obtained a PhD in Operations Research advised by Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas at MIT, and an undergrad degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur.

At nference, I've been at the forefront of developing innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate AI with healthcare workflows. Notably, I led the design and implementation of a chat-based copilot that revolutionizes disease risk prediction by leveraging cutting-edge language models integrated with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Additionally, my work on multimodal deep-learning models for predicting heart conditions has earned FDA Breakthrough Device Designation, highlighting our commitment to driving tangible impact in cardiovascular healthcare.

A significant aspect of my work involves translating research findings into practical applications. I have led efforts to productionize cutting-edge research, serving as a technical lead for multiple product launches. Additionally, I actively manage collaborative research initiatives with academic institutions, fostering a culture of innovation and knowledge exchange.
