# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this study, we analyzed data from 89,843 individuals with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We found that chronic pulmonary disease (CPD), a history of migraine, and fibromyalgia were associated with higher risk of long COVID. Abnormal lab measurements during acute infection, such as high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, were found to be high risk factors for long COVID.
